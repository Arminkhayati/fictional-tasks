Project status:

Until now, feature extraction, feature processing and feature analyzing is done on these two datasets: 

- NoteChat dataset from hugging face (on 100 data points)
- MTS dataset (on 250 data points)

My approach is motivated by these papers:

- Large Language Models are Few-Shot Clinical Information Extractors
- Product Attribute Value Extraction using Large Language Models
- An Empirical Study of Clinical Note Generation from Doctor-Patient Encounters
